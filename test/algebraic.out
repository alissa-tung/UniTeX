algebraic over 𝐹 if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied 
  (1) 𝑓(𝑎) = 0 for a non-zero polynomial 𝑓(𝑋) ∈ 𝐹[𝑋]
  (2) elements 1, 𝑎, 𝑎², ⋯ are linearly dependent over 𝐹
  (3) F-vector space 𝐹[𝑎] = { ∑ 𝑎ₖ𝑎ᵏ : 𝑎ₖ ∈ 𝐹 } is of finite dimension over 𝐹
  (4) 𝐹[𝑎] = 𝐹(𝑎)

𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑓. Omitted.

  For an element a algebraic over 𝐹 denote by
                                𝑓ₐ(𝑋) ∈ 𝐹[𝑋]
the monic polynomial of minimal degree such that 𝑓ₐ(𝑎) = 0. 
  This polynomial is irreducible. 𝑓ₐ(𝑋) is a linear polynomial iff 𝑎 ∈ 𝐹.

𝐋𝐞𝐦𝐦𝐚. Define a ring homomorphism 𝐹[𝑋] → 𝐿, 𝑔(𝑋) → 𝑔(𝑎). Its kernel is the
principal ideal generated by 𝑓ₐ(𝑋) and its image is 𝐹(𝑎), so
                              𝐹[𝑋]/(𝑓ₐ(𝑋)) ≅ 𝐹(𝑎)
𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑓. Using the division algorithm.
                            
𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. A field 𝐿 is called algebraic over its subfield 𝐹 if every element of 𝐿 is
algebraic over 𝐹. The extension 𝐿/𝐹 is called algebraic. 

𝐃𝐞𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧. Let 𝐹 be a subfield of a field 𝐿. The dimension of 𝐿 as a vector space
over 𝐹 is called the degree [𝐿 : 𝐹] of the extension 𝐿/𝐹.

  If a is algebraic over 𝐹 then [𝐹(𝑎) : 𝐹] is finite and it equals the degree of the
monic irreducible polynomial 𝑓𝑎 of a over 𝐹.
