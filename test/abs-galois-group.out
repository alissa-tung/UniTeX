1. the absolute Galois group G_K of a field K is Gal(Kˢep/K) 
i.e. the Galois group of Kˢep over K, where Kˢep is a separable closure of K.

2. When K is a perfect field, Kˢep is the same as an algebraic closure Kᵃlg of K. 
This holds e.g. for K of characteristic zero, or K a finite field. 

3. The absolute Galois group of a finite field K is isomorphic to the group
𝐙-hat := lim_← 𝐙/n𝐙. 

4. G_ℚ := Gal(ℚ-bar/ℚ), where ℚ-bar or Q̄ is the algebraic closure of 
the field of rational numbers i.e. the field of algebraic numbers.
